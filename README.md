# Sensor Data Accelerator for Microwatt

## Project Overview  
Designing a hardware accelerator module to preprocess sensor data, improving Microwatt CPU efficiency and real-time capability.

## Objectives  
- Develop a Verilog module compatible with Microwatt.
- Verify with testbenches and simulations.
- Interface using the Wishbone bus protocol.

## Motivation  
To enhance real-time sensor data processing for embedded systems by offloading tasks to hardware.

## Planned Approach  
Study Microwatt CPU bus interfaces, design and simulate the accelerator module, and test using GHDL/Vivado.

## Project Status  
Planning and initial repository setup.
